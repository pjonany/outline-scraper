Acts 26:18:
A. "Because of the merciful compassions of our God, in which the rising sun will visit us from on high, to shine upon those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace" —Luke 1:78-79; 6:36; Lam. 3:22-23.
B. "Unto you who fear My name will the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings, and you will go forth and leap about like well-fed calves"-Mal. 4:2; Psa. 84:11; 86:11.

E. "The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day" —Prov. 4:18; Phil.
2:15-16a.
"Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father"-Matt. 13:43a.
II. The centurion saw that the Lord was One who had authority because the Lord was a man under authority-8:5-13:
A. The centurion recognized that the Lord was a man under authority when he said, "I also am a man under authority"; since the centurion was a man under authority, he had the authority to command those under him—v. 9a:
1. As the God-man in His humanity on the earth, the Lord Jesus was absolutely under the ruling of the divine life of the Father-John 5:19; 4:34; 17:4; 14:10, 24; 5:30; 7:18.
2. As a man, He rejected His natural humanity and lived a human life under the restriction of the divine life of the heavenly Father.
3. By practically being under the ruling of the divine life of the Father, He was reigning in life-Phil. 2:8-11.
4. Because He was a man under the Father's authority, He had the authority of the Father.
